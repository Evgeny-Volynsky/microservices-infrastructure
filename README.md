The sequence diagram illustrates the process of setting up a secure Kubernetes cluster as part of Stage 1: Setting Up Secure Kubernetes Cluster. The diagram showcases the components involved and the sequence of actions performed during the setup process.

1. **Ansible:** The process starts with Ansible, a configuration management and automation tool. Ansible is responsible for installing a multi-node OpenStack infrastructure.

2. **OpenStack:** OpenStack is the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform used for cloud computing. In this context, OpenStack integrates with Ansible to create the multi-node infrastructure required for the Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Ceph Storage:** Ceph Storage is integrated as a separate compute node to provide persistent volumes for the Kubernetes cluster. It ensures the availability and reliability of storage resources for the microservices.

4. **Terraform:** Terraform is a provisioning tool used to automate the installation of the Kubernetes cluster. It integrates with OpenStack to deploy and manage the cluster infrastructure.

5. **Kubernetes Cluster:** The Kubernetes Cluster is the core component of the setup. It is responsible for managing and orchestrating the microservices. The cluster is installed using Terraform, ensuring a secure and scalable environment for the microservices.

6. **ArgoCD:** ArgoCD is a GitOps tool used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). It integrates with the Kubernetes Cluster to enable GitOps workflows, allowing for automated deployments and management of microservices.

7. **Microservices:** The diagram represents the automatic deployment of microservices on the Kubernetes Cluster. These microservices are the applications and services that will run within the cluster, providing the desired functionality.
